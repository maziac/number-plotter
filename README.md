The "Number Plotter" takes a series of selected numbers and creates a plot out of it.





# Available Charts

Each selected line becomes one data series in the chart.

## Line / Bar Chart

The user can select if this is shown as line or bar chart via a button.
All points are shown at equidistant positions.

The data is expected to be in either of 2 different formats.
The user can switch x/y via a button.

### Format 1: Alternating x/y positions

The x/y positions alternate, e.g.:
0.1,1.0, 0.3,1.5
